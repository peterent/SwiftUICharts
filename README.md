# SwiftUICharts
Simple, animated, charts using SwiftUI

This project shows one way to use SwiftUI to make some simple charts. There is a `ColumnChart` and a `BarChart` that animate when their data changes. The data for these charts is an array of Double values that represent percentages. To make things a little easier there is a `ChartModel` that can take any array of Double and transform it into percentage values.

An example shows how to use the chart views, including custom data formatters to show values on the charts. Axes and grid lines can also be applied.
